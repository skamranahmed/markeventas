ðŸ—“ Create Google Calendar Events from Tweet.

You just need to reply `@markeventas <event_name> | <date> | <time> | <timezone>` to any tweet.

## Demo
(In progress, currently working on the frontend)

## Why I built this?
### ðŸ˜© The problem
- There were a lot of events happening on twitter specially twitter spaces and I was missing most of them.

- Twitter does provide an option of setting a reminder for Twitter Spaces but at the same time it doesn't have an option to collectively go through the list of all the Twitter Spaces for which one has set a reminder.

- A solution that I could think of was to why not link all the Twitter Spaces that I wish to attend, directly with my Google Calendar.

- Most of us already use Google Calendar in our daily lives and this would be an easy way to track all the twitter events as well.

### ðŸ’¡ The Solution

- You just need to reply `@markeventas <event_name> | <date> | <time> | <timezone>` to any tweet.

- This is not only limited to Twitter Spaces. You can literally create an event for any tweet. Example:
    - Suppose someone tweeted about organizing a meetup on Sunday at 9PM Indian Standart Time.
        - You can create an event for it by replying `@markeventas Sunday Meetup | 25th Aug, 2022 | 9 PM | IST` to the tweet.

## ðŸ§  How does it work?
- The first step is that the user will **sign-in`** using Twitter from the frontend.
- The **sign-in** Twitter link is generated by the backend as the link needs to include information about the Twitter App to which the user is authorizing the consent.
- Once the user successfully completes the Twitter oAuth sign-in process, Twitter makes a callback request to the callback URL which contains an **oauth_token** and **oauth_verifier**
- An API call is being made to send this **oauth_token** and **oauth_verifier** to the backend.
- Using the **oauth_token** and **oauth_verifier**, the user details are fetched from the twitter in the backend and eventually a user record is created in the database (in case the user record does not currently exist in the DB).
- After this, the user is supposed to provide the **Google oAuth Consent** for **Calendar** from the frontend.
- Once, the user provides the Google Calendar Consent, a **code** is received from Google via callback in the frontend.
- This **code** is sent to the backend and is used to fetch and save the **access_token** and **refresh_token** for the user for creating Google Calendar Event(s).
